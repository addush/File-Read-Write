# File-Read-Write
Python program that combines both your "File Read & Write Challenge" and the "Error Handling Lab":

Program explanation:
Asks the user for a filename.

Attempts to open and read the file; if the file doesn't exist or can't be read, it shows an error message.

Converts the content to uppercase (you can modify the processing logic if desired).

Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed with modified_.

Prints a success message when done.
